            <p>This is truly an almighty mountain. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Let's make a happy little mountain now. It's important to me that you're happy.</p>

        <div class="flex-item">
            <p>I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. All those little son of a guns. In life you need colors.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex-item">
            <p>By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning.</p>
